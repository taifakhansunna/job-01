    <p>Sylhet is a major city and the administrative capital of the Sylhet Division, situated in the northeastern part of Bangladesh. Often referred to as the "Spiritual Capital" of the country, it is a key pilgrimage site, primarily home to the shrine of the revered Sufi saint, Hazrat Shahjalal (R.). Located on the banks of the Surma River, Sylhet is most famous for its stunning natural beauty and the vast expanses of lush green tea gardens that blanket its rolling hills. The region is rich in natural resources like gas and stone, and is a major hub for expatriates, whose remittances significantly boost the national economy. Popular tourist spots like Jaflong, Bichnakandi, and Ratargul Swamp Forest draw visitors year-round, making Sylhet a vibrant blend of historical reverence, economic importance, and captivating scenery.</p>
